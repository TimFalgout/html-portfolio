<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 51 year old trying to learn web development.</p>

<p>I spent the last 28 years working for Ingram Entertainment as an Operations Manager. We distributed home entertainment products, primarily DVD, video games and music. Due to the trend towards streaming services Ingram Entertainment hadn't made a profit since 2021. Unfortunately, Mr. Ingram decided that he could no longer support the failing company and closed down all warehouses over a two year period. All employee's that left in good standing received a severance package. I am betting on myself with my severance by trying to learn to code and hopefully get employed in the web development field at some point.

<p>I enjoy running, biking and playing with computers. I have a high school deploma from Roseburg High School as well as some credits from Umpqua Community College and the online school University of Pheonix.</p>
