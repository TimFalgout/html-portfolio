      I am 51 years old and live in beautiful Oregon near Mt. Hood. I am
      studying to learn web development.

      I spent the last 28 years working for Ingram Entertainment as an
      Operations Manager. We distributed home entertainment products, primarily
      DVD, video games and music. Due to the trend towards streaming services
      Ingram Entertainment hadn't made a profit since 2021. Unfortunately, Mr.
      Ingram decided that he could no longer support the failing company and
      closed down all warehouses over a two year period. All employee's that
      left in good standing received a severance package. I am betting on myself
      with my severance by trying to learn to code and hopefully get employed in
      the web development field at some point.

      deploma from Roseburg High School. I also have received 19 certificates
      from Codecademy and Coursera including introduction courses to HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, Python, C++ and more. I am currently taking a full-stack web
      developer course from Udemy.
